## Dmacplus Sample Code
This repository provides a sample implementation for transferring data between the Media Engine (Me) and the main CPU (Sc) using DMACPlus hardware registers.

It draws one half of a 'clock' on the Me side and the other half on the Sc side, then gathers the data using two DMACPlus channels and LLIs.

# Requirements
Run `./build.sh` from a bash shell.
